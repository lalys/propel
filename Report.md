## Description
For our problem we chose to do small or large from the General Program Synthesis Benchmark Suite. We wanted to do somehting similar to the fizz buzz problem that we went over in class to make sure that we are understanding it.

## How we set up the problem
To set up the problem, we looked at the fizz buzz problem and based our code off of that. Of course, we had to add our own constants and functions to make it work. 

## Results
Ours first results weren't that good because we had our range set up to only have one small number which made the tests become filled with only large. We also got some largesmall and smalllarge prints which isn't what we want. 

## What we tried
